Stir the cinnamon in thoroughly at this stage\nthen add the syrup (if you add the cinnamon after the syrup you will have lumps of\ncinnamon),\n\nBoil the sugar & syrup - obviously, be very careful & don't let children in the kitchen\nin this stage! After a few minutes on a rolling boil, put a small spoonful of the jelly\nonto a saucer and push it with a fingernail: when the jelly crinkles when pushed, it\n\nwill set & is ready to be put into jars.\n\nHints -\nDon't waste time peeling the apples - they're going through a jelly bag later, which\nwill catch the peel.\n\nFor these quantities, use two large saucepans with 2lb fruit & 1.5 pints water in each\nfor the first stage,\n\nIf you don't have a jelly bag stand, then use an upturned stool or chair & pin the jelly\nbag to the feet.\n\n\u2018When pouring, if you have a heatproot pouring jug, pour the jelly into this then into\nthe jars. If not, use a ladle and wear rubber gloves,\n\n"}, {"title": "Eierpunsch", "servings": 0, "ingredients_text_raw": "Ingredients:\n\neggs\n110g sugar\n\n1 tsp vanilla essence\n\nAcloves\n\npinch cinnamon\n\n250m! strong black tea, left to cool\njuice of 1 lemon\n\n1 bottle white wine (doesn\u2019t need to\nbe particularly good wine)\n\nwhipping cream to serve\n\nPhoto:\nsee page 168, bottom left panel\n", "recipe_text": "Whisk the eggs & sugar with a little of the wine, Add the rest of the ingredients\n(except the cream) and heat GENTLY on the stove, stirring constantly (we don't want\nthe eggs to scramble], and without allowing it to boil\n\nWhip the cream until stiff enough to sit on the top of a mug full of liquid.
