IndexIntroduction
1Our approach to cooking is simple: it’s about what you *can* eat, not
what you *can’t*. This is why we’ve called our book ‘incidentally
gluten-free’ - we try to focus more on recipes that don’t need a gluten-
free alternative, because that’s the kind of food we usually cook.
These are recipes we really do make. We’re both very busy people
but we enjoy cooking and baking. We hope our recipes are easy to
follow and we encourage you to experiment however you want. Don’t
follow our recipes to the letter if you don’t want to, and don’t take the
ingredients or measurements as gospel: a little bit more, a bit less,
leave out cardamom if you don’t like it, try putting in pine nuts if you
think it might be nice...it’s about making food you want to cook & eat,
not about making it ‘right’.
To help you along the way to making ‘our’ recipes into ‘your’ recipes,
we’ve given suggestions for other things you can do with them
wherever we can. We’ve also made a note of recipes which are
vegetarian, vegan and/or dairy-free, or which can be adjusted to make
them so.
So cook, bakesperiment, and most importantly ENJOY.
2About Us
We met at school 20 years ago (you know how there’s always one person left over
when you have to pair up in PE? There were two in our year). We’ve both moved
away & around a lot since but we’ve managed to keep in touch. We started collecting
gluten-free recipes a while ago and when Melanie suggested putting together a
cookbook, Karla quickly agreed!
Melanie first started eating gluten-free (and low carb) in her early 20s, after a year
of steadily worsening gastrointestinal problems, anaemia and weight loss which the
doctors could not cure. She decided to put herself on an exclusion diet. After just six
weeks, the symptoms had fully resolved and she was no longer taking any of the
medications. Obviously, she's been eating this way ever since - despite the doctors
claiming it was just a coincidence! Now her family are all eating gluten-free too,
including her two young children, the pet rat and the mental cat.
Karla
I first started paying attention to gluten-free cooking after Melanie went gluten-free: if
there’s one thing I love, it’s the challenge of a dietary requirement (ok, mostly it’s the
smugness of being able to say ‘oh, that’s NO problem, DO come round to dinner, but of
COURSE you must’). I’m lucky enough not to need to be gluten-free. As a result, most
of my (non-baking) recipes are recipes that don’t have a whiff of an ‘alternative’ to
them: they’re just recipes that have no gluten in.
One thing we hope to do here is to show people that cooking gluten-free doesn’t need
to be a chore, or a panic to address a ‘difficult’ dinner guest. Everyone makes recipes
that don’t have gluten in all the time - they just don’t realise it!
Cooking and baking gluten-free isn’t difficult, or even that different. And hopefully
once you’ve tried some of our recipes, you’ll agree with us that eating gluten-free
shouldn’t be a bind. Our approach is that the gluten-free food should taste at least as
good as, and hopefully better than, other food. Otherwise we just don’t bother with it.
There is so much delicious food out there...
3Foreword by Peter Dobromylskyj
Gluten-containing grains have been part of human history for only about 10,000 years. In
terms of human evolution, this represents an extremely short time span and our adaptation
to this novel food source is far from complete.
The classical form of gluten intolerance is coeliac disease, which usually presents as a
very severe form of diarrhoea and weight loss in young people. Accounts from ancient
Rome clearly describe this illness and its management.
The incidence of coeliac disease has been gradually revised upwards from one in 2000 of
the population to the current estimate of one in 100. At the same time the range of illnesses
which are associated with gluten intolerance has expanded. Initially diarrhoea and certain
forms of skin disease (dermatitis herpetiformis) were seen as the only conditions clearly
triggered by gluten, but in modern times the range of conditions in which gluten intolerance
is suspected has become enormous (see page 183).
Coeliac disease is diagnosed by the detection of a certain antibody in the bloodstream and is
then normally confirmed by gut biopsy. If you do not have the ‘correct’ antibody on the
blood test you will not be diagnosed as a coeliac. This currently places marked limitations
on who is classified with fully-confirmed coeliac disease. However, many people who are
technically not coeliacs find improvement in a wide variety of health problems when they
eliminate gluten from their diet. This leads us to the rather fascinating question of quite
why gluten is so bad for so many of us – if you want to read more on this, turn to page 183.
There is no single nutritional component of gluten which cannot be better supplied by meat,
eggs and vegetables. Even cakes based around almonds and eggs carry a hugely higher
nutrient content than those based around white flour. There is a reasonable case to be
made for anyone with an "idiopathic" inflammatory disease (i.e. of unknown cause) to trial a
gluten-free diet. Food which is incidentally gluten-free can be delicious in its own right and
no one ever died of gluten deficiency.

5Chapter 1 - Fish Dishes
6Tinned Tuna Fish Cakes
Makes 6 fish cakes – serves 2 - 3.
Ingredients:Thoroughly drain the tuna and place it in a bowl. Break up any large chunks.
1 small tin of flaked tuna fish, in water
or brine (185g undrained)Add the eggs and the ground almonds and mix well.
Add the ground cumin, salt and pepper to taste (season well).
50g ground almonds
2 eggs
fresh coriander and chives
salt and pepper, to taste
red chilli flakes (optional)
1⁄2 tbsp ground cumin
20g cheddar, finely grated

Chop the fresh coriander and chives, then mix them in together with the chilli flakes,
if using.
Mix in the grated cheddar. Divide the mixture into 6 equal parts.
Heat the fat in a frying pan, until you have at least 1 - 2cm depth.
Roll the fish cake mix into balls and then flatten them slightly. Place them in the pan.
Cook over a medium heat, moving them occasionally so they do not stick. After
about 5 minutes, turn them over. Cook for a further 5 - 10 minutes or until golden
brown on both sides.
Drain on kitchen roll and serve with a lemon wedge and a dollop of sour cream.

Add the prawns to the pan and cook for 1 - 2 minutes, or until they have just turned
opaque. Then remove them and add them to the ovenproof dish with the salmon and
garlic. Slice the hardboiled eggs and layer them on top of the salmon and prawns.
Wilt the spinach in a saucepan or in the microwave, and spoon it over the eggs.
Make a cheese sauce by melting the rindless brie in the frying pan (add more butter
if needed) and adding enough double cream to make it a nice and thick but pourable
consistency. Season with black pepper to taste. Pour the sauce over the fish, eggs
and spinach in the ovenproof dish.
Sprinkle ground almonds over the top until the contents are completely covered.
Cook in the oven for about 20 minutes, until the almonds are light golden brown and
the mixture is bubbling. Serve with a nice glass of chilled white wine.
Alternatives -
Try adding other cheeses to the sauce, e.g. mozzarella.9Cauliflower Cheese with Tuna
A versatile recipe, including the easiest ever cheese sauce – you never need struggle to make a roux ever again, gluten-free or
otherwise! Leave out the tuna for a nice vegetarian main. Serves 2 - 4.
**potentially vegetarian**
Ingredients:
1 small - medium cauliflower
300g soft cream cheese
1 small tin of tuna (185g)
grated cheddar cheese
double cream
ground black pepper, to taste
fresh chopped chives (optional)
Chop the cauliflower into florets, and cook (boil or steam) for about 10 minutes until
just done or al dente. Strain away the water and keep the cauliflower to one side.
Preheat the oven to around 180°C (350°F/GM4) or preheat the grill.
Melt the soft cheese in a small pan or frying pan. Once melted, add plenty of grated
cheddar cheese and ground black pepper, both to taste. Add double cream until you
reach the white sauce consistency you like. Add the tuna and mix well. Add the
chopped chives.
Place the cauliflower into an ovenproof dish and pour the cheese sauce over the top,
ensuring all the cauliflower is well coated. Sprinkle a little extra cheddar over the
top and place in a hot oven or under the grill for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce
is bubbling and the cheese on top has melted and turned brown.
Alternatives -
Make this into a vegetarian dish simply by leaving out the tuna.
Leave out the tuna and the cheese for a simple side dish of cauliflower in white
sauce.

10Easy Peasy Fish Pie
Serves 2 - 3 as a sole dish, serves 4 with vegetables as a side.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
Pie Filling -
300g mixed fish, including salmon,
smoked fish and white fish
200g prawns
300g soft cream cheese
10g butter
olive oil with garlic
1 green bell pepper, diced
salt and pepper, to taste
chopped fresh chives, to tasteThe Filling -
Melt the butter with the olive oil in a frying pan. Cook the green pepper for a few
minutes. Add the fish and cook gently until just done. Add the prawns and cook for
a few more minutes, until the prawns are opaque. Add the cream cheese and heat
gently until melted. Add the chives and season to taste. Pour into an oven proof
dish.
Savoury Crumble Topping -
2:1 ratio ground almonds : potato
flour
butter, cubed
salt and pepper, to taste
The Savoury Crumble Topping -
Mix the ground almonds and potato flour (other gluten-free flours would also work
fine), adding in the salt and pepper to taste. Add the butter and rub it into the flour
until it forms a crumble-like topping. You can use a food processor for this, but you
may need to do the last bit by hand to get the right crumb-like texture. If it’s too
sticky (i.e. big sticky crumbs) add a little more flour or almonds. If it’s too dry (i.e. not
forming crumbs) add more butter.
Sprinkle the topping over the fish mixture. Cook in the oven at 180°C (350°F/GM4)
for about 30 minutes or until the topping is turning golden brown and the mixture is
bubbling.

11Spicy Coated White Fish
This is a simple Mexican recipe for giving any firm fleshed white fish a light but tasty coating. Simply adjust the amounts according to
how much fish you have.
Ingredients:
firm fleshed white fish, e.g. cod,
haddock, cut into large chunks
1 egg, beaten
fat, for frying
The Coating -
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp ground cumin
1⁄2 tsp chilli powder (or to taste)
1 clove of garlic, crushed or finely
diced (or 1 tsp powdered garlic)
salt and pepper, to taste
1 tbsp potato flour
(rice flour or cornflour work too)
Cut the fish into big chunks and pat dry. Pour the beaten egg into a shallow dish or
plate.
Mix together the spices, garlic and seasoning in the flour. Place it into a shallow
dish or plate. Heat the fat in a deep frying pan.
Roll each piece of fish in the egg, then in the coating mix. Roll it over several times
and pat the coating evenly onto the fish, covering all sides, top and bottom.
Simply fry the coated chunks of fish until just cooked through and the coating is
slightly golden brown.
Serve with a wedge of lemon.
Alternatives -
Leave out the chilli powder and go easy on the pepper for a non-spicy fish finger
replacement for children.

12Spiced Coconut Fish
A spoonful of mango chutney stirred in goes especially nicely with this. Throw in some vegetables (sliced peppers etc) to make this
more substantial. Serves 2.
Ingredients:Cut the fish into approximately 5cm chunks.
2 chunky white fish fillets
(cod works well, but monkfish, halibut
etc are good alternatives)Melt the oil or butter in a frying pan and fry the onion, garlic, coriander, cumin and
turmeric gently for 2 - 3 minutes.
oil or butter, for frying
1 onion, sliced
garlic, crushed
approx 1 tsp each of:
ground coriander
ground cumin
ground turmeric
1⁄2 tin of coconut milk
1⁄2 tin of chopped tomatoes (200g)
Add the coconut milk & tomatoes (approximately 50:50 ratio or to taste) & simmer
for 4 - 5 minutes.
Add the fish & cook gently until the fish is opaque and flakes easily (5 - 10 minutes).
Serve with rice.
Alternatives -
You can also do this with chicken or lamb - just cook the meat through first.

1314Chilli Prawns
It's worth getting all possible preparation done before doing any cooking for this. Be careful not to overcook the prawns!
Serves 2.
Ingredients:
300g king prawns (raw, peeled)
1 tbsp sake (sherry or white wine
make passable alternatives)
1⁄2 an egg white
1⁄2 tsp salt
1 spring onion or half a slender leek
1 garlic clove; same amount of fresh
ginger
3 tbsp salad oil
1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
3 tbsp ketchup (check gluten-free)
1⁄2 tbsp sake
1 tsp sugar
1⁄2 cube of chicken stock, in 300ml of
water
1 tbsp gluten-free flour in 2 tbsp water
(for thickening)
1⁄2 tsp vinegar
green peas (amount to taste)
Cut the spring onion, ginger and garlic very finely. Peel the prawns if you haven't
already.
Coat the prawns in sake and egg white (add a little gluten-free flour if desired).
Dissolve the salt in a little boiling water in the saucepan then add the oil, and, once
mixed, the prawns. Drain the prawns AS SOON AS they colour.
Heat oil on a low heat and add the chopped onion, ginger and garlic for a minute or
two until the fragrances are released. Add the prawns and stir once or twice then
add the sweet chilli sauce, sake, sugar, stock, vinegar & ketchup.
Add the dissolved flour-in-water mix and once it starts to thicken, add the peas. If
you want to leave out the flour, you can leave the sauce loose, or keep it boiling
down a bit - but I recommend you remove the prawns first so they don't go tough.
Serve with rice or rice noodles.

15Mackerel in Miso
Serves 2.
Ingredients:
2 mackerel fillets, bones removed
40g miso paste
1 tbsp soy sauce (omit if you don’t
like salty flavours)
1 tbsp caster sugar
300ml water
2 tbsp mirin (omit if not available)
2 tbsp sake (use sherry/white wine if
not available)
1 - 2cm fresh ginger
10cm daikon (white radish/mooli)
1 leek, fairly slender
sushi rice to serve
Score the back of the fish (this stops it shrinking), slice the ginger into small thin
matchsticks, then peel & cut the daikon into 1.5 cm-thick half moons. Set aside.
Cut the leeks into 2.5cm lengths & put onto skewers in threes.
Put the water, sake, mirin & sugar into a large flat pan on a medium heat. Add the
miso, soy sauce and ginger.
Bring to the boil, then place the fish fillets flesh-down in the liquid & simmer for
about 20 minutes.
Check regularly: add more water (and mirin & sake in smaller amounts) if it gets too
thick or tastes too salty.
Meanwhile, grill the skewered leeks & cook the rice.
Add the chopped daikon to the liquid for the last 5 minutes, then serve with rice &
the leek skewers.

16Salmon in Chilli Miso
Serves 2.
Ingredients:Put the water, sake, mirin & sugar into a large flat pan on a medium heat.
2 salmon fillets, chopped into largish
chunks
40g miso paste
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp caster sugar
200ml water
2 tbsp mirin (omit if not available)
2 tbsp sake (use sherry/white wine if
not available)
1 green pepper, sliced
1 tsp ready-chopped chillies, or 1
scant tsp chilli flakes
1 tsp white sesame seeds, toasted if
you likeAdd the miso & soy sauce.
Bring to the boil, then place the fish chunks in the liquid & simmer for about 10
minutes.
Stir in the chillies & pepper after about 5 minutes.
Serve with rice.
Ideally, the sauce for this should be thicker than for the mackerel in miso recipe.
Quantities are, as usual, very much to taste!
sushi rice to serve
17Quick and Spicy Prawns
Serves 4 as a starter or nibbles; increase the quantities for a main course.
Ingredients:Pat dry the prawns using kitchen paper.
350g prawns
(small to medium ones work the best)Mix together the flour with the spices.
Heat the fat or oil in a deep frying pan until medium hot.
50g rice flour
2 tsp turmeric
1⁄2 tsp cayenne pepper (or to taste)
2 tbsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
salt, to taste (approx. 1⁄2 tsp)
1 tsp ground black pepper
fat for frying (2cm deep)
lemon juice to serve
Coat the prawns well with the spiced flour mix and place in the pan in a single layer.
Cook for 1 - 2 minutes and turn. Cook for a further 1 - 2 minutes, then remove the
prawns from the pan and place them to drain on a kitchen towel.
Cook all the prawns this way, in batches: you may need to replenish the fat.
You can serve these with lemon wedges so people can sprinkle lemon juice over.
Serve warm and eat straight away.

1819Seafood Curry
A ridiculously simple dish which is quick to prepare and versatile. Make this as mild or spicy as you like by using whichever curry
powder you prefer. I make this with mild curry powder for the children, and just add red chillies for the adults. Serves 2.
Ingredients:
300g seafood mixture including
prawns, mussels and squid rings
(precooked)
200g prawns
butter, for frying
curry powder of your choice
(mild, etc, to taste)
3 tbsp mayonnaise
6 tbsp double cream
red chillies, sliced into rings (optional)
Prepare the curry sauce by mixing 1 part mayonnaise to 2 parts double cream
(approximately 3 tbsp mayo to 6 tbsp cream, but the amount is up to you).
Mix together well and then add the curry powder to taste. Check the taste and add
more curry powder if required.
Melt the butter in a frying pan over a gentle heat.
Add the seafood mixture and prawns (and chillies if using) and cook gently for a few
minutes: be careful not to overcook the seafood; it won’t need long.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the curry sauce.
Once well mixed, return the pan to the gentle heat and warm the sauce through until
gently bubbling – don’t overdo it!

2324Coconut Lemon Chicken
Serves 3 - 4.
Ingredients:
300g chicken fillets, diced
100g dessicated coconut
100g butter, for frying
3 medium onions, finely sliced
4 cloves of garlic, finely sliced
2cm piece of fresh ginger, finely diced
rind of half a lemon, cut into thin slivers

coconut onto the tea towel within the jug. Pour enough boiling water to just cover the
coconut and leave for 30 minutes (see photo on opposite page, bottom left panel).
Carefully lift out the coconut in the tea towel, and holding it above the jug, twist the
tea towel to extract all of the milk. Be careful when handling, as it may still be hot.
Melt the butter in a wok or large frying pan and cook the chicken until browned on
the surface (approximately 5 minutes).
Add the onions, ginger, garlic and lemon peel and continue to fry for a further 5
minutes.
Add in the coconut milk, soy sauce and lemon juice. Reduce the sauce down over a
high heat for about 20 minutes.

34Melanie’s Special Chicken
Also known as NFC or Nuthin’ Fried Chicken.
Ingredients:
chicken drumsticks, 2 - 4 per person
stock, or a stock cube
200g soft cream cheese
1 egg yolk
1 tbsp each: paprika, oregano, cumin,
garlic granules, onion granules
hot chilli powder, to taste
salt and pepper, to taste
1 tbsp rice flour
oil for cooking
Photo:
see page 33, top right panel
Bring a large saucepan of stock (or water with a stock cube dissolved in it) to the
boil. Carefully place the chicken drumsticks into the stock, and return it to the boil.
Reduce the heat, and simmer the chicken for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix together the spices, salt and pepper and rice flour thoroughly. Place
the spice mix onto a large plate, spreading it out.
After 20 minutes, remove the chicken from the stock using a slotted spoon and leave
the drumsticks to drain on some kitchen paper (keep the water, it makes great stock
for another dish!).
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
Gently melt the cream cheese in a frying pan. Remove it from the heat as soon as it
melts, and stir in the egg yolk. Keeping the cheese off the heat, take a chicken
drumstick and roll it in the melted cheese/egg yolk till it’s covered all over. Then roll
it in the spice mix till it’s well covered. Place the chicken in a baking tin with about
2cm of oil. Repeat the process for each drumstick.
Place the coated chicken in the oven and bake at 180°C (350°F/GM4) for about 30
minutes. Check after 15 - 20 minutes, and turn the chicken over. You may need to
increase the oven temperature to 200°C for the last 5 minutes or so, to really crisp
up the coating.

This is a Mexican recipe for fried pork.
Serves 2 - 4.
Ingredients:
1 packet of belly pork slices
1 whole bulb of garlic, chopped in half
1 onion, roughly diced
1 vegetable stock cube
1 bay leaf
1 tbsp ground cumin
hot chilli powder (optional)
salt and pepper, to taste
Place the whole strips of belly pork into a heavy bottomed pan, with the onion, a
whole bulb of garlic sliced in half, ground cumin, stock cube, bay leaf and ground
black pepper. Add water to cover and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat down very
low and cook for two hours or more. Top up the water as required.
Remove the pork from pan, keeping the stock. Slice the pork into thick chunks.
Sprinkle with salt, pepper and chilli powder to taste. Without adding additional fat,
fry the pork slowly in a frying pan for 15 - 20 minutes, turning frequently. The pork
will go crispy and brown.
Add a ladle-full of the stock to the frying pan and simmer gently until the liquid has
evaporated, turning occasionally. The pork should be crispy on the outside, but soft
and melt-in-the-mouth on the inside.
Warning – due to the high fat content, a little of this dish will go a long way....

4344Stuffed Cabbage Rolls
Serves 2.
Ingredients:
8 cabbage leaves
a pinch each of salt, pepper & rice
flour
The Filling -
2 tsp butter
1⁄2 onion, very finely sliced
250g pork mince
1 egg
3 tbsp ground almonds
1 tbsp olive oil
1⁄2 tsp salt
pinch each of pepper & nutmeg
The Sauce –
1 carrot, sliced
3 - 4 tbsp tomato purée or passata
1 sage leaf
1 stock cube and white wine:
total volume of 568ml (1 pint) of stock
and wine
1 clove of garlic, crushed
pinch of thyme and parsley
Photo: see opposite page, top left
Separate the cabbage leaves (remove the woody stem first, then they come away
easily) and boil them until they start to look translucent (will only need a couple of
minutes). Set them aside.
The Filling -
Melt the butter in a pan & add the onion. Fry until golden and then allow to cool. Mix
the meat, egg, ground almonds, olive oil, salt, pepper & nutmeg in a bowl. Then add
the cooled onion. Separate this mixture into four portions.
Dry the cabbage leaves & slice off the hardest part of the stalk. Layer two leaves
together & add a pinch of salt & pepper. Sieve over a little rice flour then place one of
the meat mixture portions in the middle. Wrap the cabbage leaf around the meat &
secure with a wooden skewer or cocktail stick. Repeat with the rest, until you have
four cabbage rolls.
The Sauce -
Dissolve the stock cube in a little water. Place the rolls in a large-bottomed pan &
add the tomato purée/passata, wine, carrot, stock, garlic clove, thyme & sage. Cover
& cook on a low heat for 30 minutes or so. When the skewers can be removed from
the rolls and only clear juice comes out, it's ready. Remove the cabbage rolls &
carrots, then thicken the sauce by bringing it to the boil & reducing it down. Add a
little cornflour or rice flour to thicken the sauce if it needs it (optional).
Serve with rice & the carrots from the sauce.
45Chilli Verde with Pork
This recipe uses tomatillos, which I’ve yet to see here in the UK in any shop but I have successfully grown them at home from seed
(see page 44, middle right and left panels). Alternatively you can use fresh tomatoes and green salsa. Serves 4.
Ingredients:
500g pork, cut into big chunks
1 onion, chopped
2 bay leaves
1 whole bulb of garlic, cut in half
1 stock cube (vegetable)
2 cloves of garlic, chopped
400g fresh tomatillos
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 Jalapeno chillies, deseeded and
chopped
oil or butter, for frying
1⁄2 tsp chilli powder
1⁄2 tsp cumin
Place the pork in a large saucepan or stock pot with the onion, the whole garlic bulb
cut in half, the bay leaves and stock cube. Cover with water and bring to the boil.
Skim off the scum, reduce the heat very low and leave to simmer very gently for at
least 2 hours (longer is fine).
Peel off the husks from the tomatillos and chop them up. Place them along with the
chopped garlic, Jalapeno chillies and green bell pepper into a food processor and
blend to a purée. (You can make batches of this and freeze for future use if you have
a glut of tomatillos – works very well).
Heat the butter or oil in a large frying pan. Add the tomatillo purée and cook over a
medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until thickened. Add a little of the stock from
the pork together with the chilli powder and cumin.
Remove the pork from the stock and add the pork to the sauce. Simmer gently for
another 20 minutes or so.
Serve this with fresh coriander leaves sprinkled on top and some lime wedges.

5152Hunkar Begendi
Lamb served with smoked aubergine in cheese sauce. A Turkish recipe, via Zorlu, made undoubtedly less authentic by me!
Serves 2.
Ingredients:
The Lamb -
3 large onions, sliced
400g lamb, diced
1 tin of chopped tomatoes (400g)
1⁄2 tsp ground cumin, or crush 1⁄2 tsp
cumin seeds
1⁄2 tsp ground paprika
400ml strong stock, preferably lamb
(from a stock cube is fine)
fresh chopped parsley
seasoning, to taste
The Aubergine -
2 medium aubergines
juice of 2 lemons
15g butter
1 tbsp cornflour/gluten-free flour
200ml milk
50g gruyère (cheddar will do)
seasoning, to taste
Photo:
see opposite, top right panel
You have to smoke the aubergines yourself for this, for which a gas hob is probably
preferable to an electric one - though I’m told that also works ok. I was also advised
to use a portable fish-smoker so if you’re the kind of person who has such a thing,
knock yourself out. Feel free to enjoy telling people that ‘smoking my own
aubergines’ is not a euphemism...
Smoke the aubergines: place over a naked flame and turn regularly until they
become charred and soft (takes 20 - 30 minutes). Place the aubergines in a plastic
bag to sweat & cool. Add the lemon juice to a bowl of water, and then peel the
aubergines when cooled. Soak the aubergines in the water for 30 minutes (you may
want to begin the lamb at this point). Mash the aubergines with a fork & set aside.
Fry the onions until golden, then add the lamb & seasoning. Brown the lamb then
add the tomatoes, cumin and paprika. Add the stock and simmer for an hour or so
until tender. Sprinkle with parsley.
Melt the butter & add the cornflour, stirring well. Add the milk slowly, stirring
constantly, then add the cheese. Add the mashed aubergine flesh to the cheese
sauce & stir really well. Season to taste.

A rather lovely curry dish based on lamb or mutton.
Serves 4 - 6.
Ingredients:
20g butter (or ghee)
600g mutton or lamb, cut into cubes
2 bay leaves & 2 cardamom pods
6 whole cloves & 6 peppercorns
1 tsp cumin seeds
2.5cm cinnamon stick
568ml (1 pint) of hot water
140ml yoghurt
The Sauce -
20g butter (or ghee)
1 onion, finely chopped
4 green cardamom pods
4 tbsp tomato purée
The Paste -
6 cloves of garlic, crushed
1 onion, coarsely chopped
2cm fresh ginger, roughly chopped
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tbsp ground coriander
2 tsp turmeric
Photo: see page 56, top right and
bottom left
Melt the butter or ghee in a large saucepan. Throw in the bay leaf, cardamom pods,
whole cloves, peppercorns, cumin seeds and cinnamon stick. Fry for about 10
seconds, stirring well. Then add in the cubed mutton or lamb, stir well and allow to
fry over a medium heat for at least 15 minutes, or until the meat is brown all over.
Meanwhile, melt the rest of the butter or ghee (for the sauce) in a large frying pan.
Add the finely chopped onion and cardamom pods and fry them gently until the
onions are soft and turning golden. Take off the heat and stir in the tomato purée.
Leave to one side whilst preparing the paste.
Place the coarsely chopped onion, garlic and ginger into a food blender or processor
and blend to a paste. Add a little water if necessary to help the process. Then mix in
the chilli powder, ground coriander and turmeric.
Add the paste to the sauce in the frying pan and return the pan to the heat. Fry
gently, whilst mixing well. After a few minutes, add the yoghurt. Cook for another
couple of minutes. Then add this mixture to the meat in the large saucepan, together
with the water and salt to taste. Cover and simmer gently for 2 - 3 hours (or
longer).
Reduce the sauce right down prior to serving. This is a great dish for mutton, as
after 3 hours the meat just melts in the mouth. Serve sprinkled with fresh chopped
coriander leaves and/or garam masala.
5556Mutton Korma
Serves 4 - 6.
Ingredients:
600g mutton (or lamb) cut into cubes
568ml (1 pint) water
4 whole cloves
5cm cinnamon stick
1 tsp cumin seeds
6 black peppercorns
4 cardamon pods
100g butter
2 onions, finely chopped

4 cloves of garlic, crushed
20g fresh ginger, finely chopped
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp chilli powder (optional, to taste)
280ml yoghurt
salt, to taste
Place the cubed mutton (or lamb) in a large saucepan together with the water. Add
the cloves, cinnamon stick, cumin seeds, peppercorns and cardamom pods. Bring to
the boil, then reduce the heat and cover the pan. Simmer gently for about 1 - 11⁄2
hours (until the meat is good and tender): the water should reduce by about half
during this time.
In the meantime, melt the butter in a large frying pan and add the onion, bay leaves,
garlic and ginger. Fry gently until the onion is golden and then add the turmeric,
garam masala and chilli powder (if using). Cook gently for a further 5 minutes,
mixing well. Add the yoghurt and salt to taste and cook for a further 5 minutes.
Once the meat is cooked, add the onion/yoghurt mixture to the large saucepan (don’t
drain the meat, just add the contents of the frying pan to those in the saucepan).
Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for at least 15 minutes, to reduce
the sauce to your desired consistency.
Scatter a chopped green chilli over the top, or garnish with fresh coriander leaves.

This recipe is a simple yet delicious way to prepare chops, either lamb or mutton. The aroma while they cook is just mmmm. They
end up with a slightly crispy yet chewy outer but are melt-in-the-mouth on the inside. Allow 1 - 2 chops per person.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
lamb or mutton chops
plenty of garlic, cut into slivers
salt and pepper, to taste
dried oregano
butterMake several small incisions into the chops, and place a sliver of garlic into each cut
(4 - 5 cuts per chop). Place a small knob of butter on top of each chop, then sprinkle
over salt, pepper and dried oregano to taste.
Wrap up each chop individually in a square of tin foil, pinching it closed at the top.
Place all of the chop parcels into a baking tray or tin, and place in the oven at 180°C
(350°F/GM4) for about 45 - 60 minutes, until the meat is very tender and falls off
the bones. The exact time depends on the size of the chops and whether lamb or
mutton – mutton might require a little longer.
Serve them in their little foil parcels.

60Spag-less Bolognese
Serves 4.
Ingredients:
1 onion, diced
500g beef mince
1 red pepper, diced
100 - 150g mushrooms, diced
1 small tin of sliced black olives
2 - 4 cloves of garlic, crushed
2 - 4 rashers of streaky bacon, cubed
1 tin of tomatoes (400g)
2 tbsp tomato purée
25g butter
2 - 4 tbsp olive oil
black pepper and salt, to taste
1 tbsp dried thyme
1 tbsp dried oregano
red wine
2 tbsp gluten-free green pesto
(optional)
Melt the butter and fry the onions in the butter till softened. Add the mince and
brown all over. Add the mushrooms, garlic, bacon and red pepper and cook for a
further few minutes till softened.
Add the tinned tomatoes, red wine, tomato purée, black olives and a couple
tablespoons of olive oil. Mix well and bring to the boil. Add water if needed to cover
(depends how much wine you've used!). Season with generous amounts of black
pepper, thyme and oregano. Add the pesto if using.
Once bubbling, reduce heat to low and allow to simmer for at least 45 minutes
(couple of hours is best). Reduce until the sauce is nice and thick. You can add more
water if needed to allow for a longer cooking time.
Check the seasoning before serving. We serve this as it is, with lots of grated
cheddar cheese melted on top. This also freezes well.
Alternatives -
Serve with spaghetti squash...cut the squash longways and boil for 10 minutes
(depends on size of chunks). Remove the squash from the water and use a fork to
make the ‘spaghetti’ strands, starting from the inside of the squash.

purée, bouquet garni, bay leaves, dried thyme and seasoning. Stir well and bring to
the boil, then reduce to minimal heat, cover and cook for several hours (the longer
the better), checking regularly that the fluid has not all evaporated – you can add
more water if necessary. This recipe would also work well in a slow cooker.
Check the seasoning and adjust if needed before serving.
This also freezes well.
Alternatives -
This recipe can be adapted to whatever and however much veg you have knocking
around in the bottom of the fridge - parsnips, potatoes etc work well too.
If you don't have stock or gluten-free stock cubes, then marmite works well as a
substitute!
The red wine is optional, but it does make it taste extra nice...
This recipe also works very well with lamb or mutton.African Beef Stew

You can usually get very, very thinly sliced beef in a Chinese supermarket. If you can’t, then this recipe works just as well with diced
beef: fry it for longer to be sure it’ll cook through. Serves 2.
Ingredients:Peel & slice the carrots into 1 cm thick slices (half-moon if need be).
200g beef, very thinly sliced
6 small potatoes
1 carrot
1 onion
shirataki (this is a noodle made from
yam)
1.5 tbsp salad oil or butter
2 tbsp sugar
3 tbsp mirin
2 tbsp sake (alternatively sherry/white
wine)
5 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp green peasSlice the onion into large strips.
Peel & slice the potatoes into sizeable chunks & put into some cold water.
Boil the shirataki for a couple of minutes.
Fry the meat in the butter quickly, then add the shirataki. Mix together, then add the
potatoes & half the onions.
Add 350ml water, cover & bring to the boil, then reduce the heat. Remove any scum
from the top occasionally, if necessary.
When you can easily get a skewer 3mm into the potato, then add the sugar, mirin,
sake and then the soy sauce. Add the carrots. Cover & cook for 10 minutes.
Add the rest of the onion & cook, uncovered, for about 7 minutes.
Finally, add the peas.
This is also nice served as one part of a meal with lots of little parts, in a tapas-way.

753 Colour Tartlets
I find making gluten-free savoury pastry quite a challenge, but I think I’ve cracked it with this recipe.
Makes 12 tartlets.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Savoury pastry -
75g potato flour
75g rice flour
75g ground almonds
salt, to taste
1 tbsp xanthan gum
1 egg
50g butter
olive oilThe Savoury Pastry -
Mix the dry ingredients together (flours, almonds, salt and gum). Add the egg and
the butter, then mix together till you get a fine crumb. Gather the pastry together into
a ball, adding as much olive oil as needed to hold it together. I find that the ‘wetter’
the better with this pastry (don’t expect the same pastry rules to apply to gluten-free
pastry). I add plenty of oil, so that the pastry holds together easily and is actually
smooth and rather greasy to the touch.
The Filling -
1 tin of tomatoes (400g)
garlic-flavoured olive oil
salt and pepper, to taste
thyme, oregano, to taste
1⁄2 tsp sugar
dash of balsamic vinegar
feta
gluten-free green pesto
Photo:
see page 78, top row
76
It can be refridgerated overnight or frozen if needed, but I don’t find cooling it helps
with the handling, so I don’t bother unless it’s for storage reasons.
Roll the pastry out sandwiched between two sheets of grease-proof paper (this
works really well, so don’t worry about dusting surfaces with flour – it simply
makes a mess and dries out your pastry!) Cut out 12 circles to fit your tin – I find a
shallow, 12-hole bun tin works well. Don’t roll the pastry out too thin, and be careful
transferring it to the tin as it will break easily. If it rips, simply roll it up and start
again – have patience with it!
Blind bake the pastry for 10 minutes at 180°C (350°F/GM4). Remove them from the
oven, coat the pastry with egg wash and return to the oven for 2 minutes.The Filling -
This is only a suggestion; you can fill these with whatever you fancy!
Warm the garlic-flavoured olive oil in a frying pan and add the tomatoes.
Cook gently until the juice has almost completely disappeared.
Season to taste with salt, pepper, oregano and thyme.
Add a small amount of sugar (exact amount depends on the tomatoes) and sprinkle
a little balsamic vinegar over at the last minute.
Mix well and spoon this into the tartlets.
Crumble a little feta over the top and return them to the oven for 10 minutes.
Once cooked, serve drizzled with a little gluten-free green pesto over the top.
You can serve these warm or cold. Good finger food for buffets.
7778Nutty-base Vegetarian Quiche
No pastry!
Makes a 20cm (8 inch) diameter quiche.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Nutty-base –
50g chopped almonds
50g other chopped nuts
50g ground almonds
2 eggs
30g melted butter
pinch of saltThe Base -
Mix together the nuts with the melted butter, eggs, salt and xanthan gum. Use a tin
approximately 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter (preferably with a removable base),
grease the tin and line with grease-proof paper. Pack the nut mix firmly into the base
and bake for 15 minutes at 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Filling -
1 onion, finely diced
butter, for frying
1 red and 1 orange pepper, fined
diced
1 small tin of sliced black olives
150g grated cheddar
350ml (12 fl oz) double cream
1 tbsp xanthan gum
4 eggs
salt and pepper, to taste
The Filling -
Melt the butter in a frying pan, and fry the onion until softened. Add the peppers and
olives and fry until cooked through. Place the onion, peppers and olives onto the
precooked nut base. Sprinkle the grated cheddar over the vegetables. Mix together
the double cream, eggs and seasoning to taste. Pour this mixture over the
vegetables and cheddar. Bake at 180°C (350°F/GM4) for a further 50 - 60 minutes,
until golden brown on top. Place a tray underneath to catch any drips!
You can serve this warm or cold and the firm base means it makes good finger food.
It also keeps well.
79Baked Butternut Squash with Goat’s Cheese

homemade is amazing, and can be
made without parmesan for a vegan
risotto)
Heat the oil & fry the onion & garlic for a minute or so, then add the rice & coat in the
oil.
Add the stock a little at a time, stirring fairly constantly.
Throw in the mushrooms and peppers at some point during the cooking (when rice
is halfway cooked, or later if you want more crunch in the peppers).
When the rice is nearly cooked, add a big slog of cream then stir in a big spoonful of
pesto (amount to taste).
Just before serving, throw in the feta & toasted pine nuts, then stir for one last
minute. The feta will juuuust start to go soft around the edges.

91Tomato Soup, with a Kick
I sometimes take this to work in a soup flask, for a nice warm lunch.
Serves 2.
**vegetarian, can be vegan**

salt and black pepper, to taste
double cream
ground cumin and coriander, to taste
pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)Fry gently for a few seconds, then add the tomatoes, water, lemon grass, cumin and
coriander (to taste: I add plenty!).
Bring gently to bubble, then turn down low and leave to cook for about 30 minutes
or longer, or until the tomato juice has reduced down.
Remove the pan from the heat. At this stage, if you like your soup smooth you can
blend it quickly in a food blender. Otherwise, if you like chunks of tomato in your
soup leave it as it is!
Add a generous amount of double cream (to taste), and check for seasoning. Add
salt and pepper to taste if required. If you like an extra kick to your soup, add the
cayenne pepper too.
This is really nice served with a sprinkling of fresh chopped coriander leaves.

102Flour-free Pizza
This is a very filling recipe as the base contains nuts and eggs and is thus highly nutritious in its own right.
Each pizza serves 1 - 2.
**potentially vegetarian**
Ingredients:
The Base –
3 eggs
100g ground almonds
1 red onion, finely diced (optional)
garlic, crushed (optional)
seasoning, to taste
oil or butter, for frying
The Tomato Topping -
green pesto (gluten-free)
tomato purée
generous amount of oregano
Toppings -
your choice; see across for
suggestions
lots of grated cheddar cheese
Photo:
see page 108, top left panel - pre-
baked, top middle panel - baked
The Base -
Mix three eggs per 100g ground almonds - how much in total depends on how thick
you want to make the base, and how many pizzas you are making. This is just a
ratio.
Optional – you can add some finely diced and fried red onion and also garlic – this
helps give the base a bit more moisture and also an extra delicious taste so it's
strongly recommended. Season well.
Melt some oil or butter in a small frying pan – this will be the size of your pizza. Add
a spoonful of the mix; enough to coat the base of the pan. Cook the base through,
flipping part-way so it's cooked on both sides. Remove from the pan and place on an
oven proof tray.
The Tomato Topping -
Mix together some green pesto with tomato purée, about a 50:50 ratio. Add a
generous amount of oregano: this makes it taste like pizza! Spread a thin layer of this
over the cooked pizza base: you don’t need a lot as it is very strong.
Then add toppings of your choice! I like salami or ham or pepperoni, sliced olives,
finely chopped mushrooms or pepper, goat’s cheese... Mozzarella is a must for the
stringy cheese effect...be generous with your toppings. Then add lots of grated
cheddar cheese and place under a grill to melt.
Warning - this is a very filling pizza....
103Spanish Tortilla
This is a recipe from my sister Zoe, who made this for a packed lunch to take on field trips.
Serves 4.
Ingredients:
150ml olive oil
750g potatoes, thinly sliced or cubed
1 large onion, sliced
1 red pepper, cored, deseeded and
sliced
1 green pepper, cored, deseeded
and sliced
5 large eggs
salt and pepper, to taste
**vegetarian**
Heat all but 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan. Add the potato slices, onion
and peppers and cook for 15 minutes stirring well, until all the vegetables are golden
and tender.
In a bowl, beat the eggs then stir in the potato mixture from the pan and add a dash
of salt and pepper. Put on one side to stand for 15 minutes.
Heat the rest of the oil in the frying pan and tip in the tortilla mixture. Cook over a
low heat for 10 minutes, until almost cooked through. Flip over and cook the other
side for another 5 minutes, or until the tortilla is cooked on both sides. Leave it to
cool then cut into wedges.
Note that the times given are only a guide; you may need to cook it for longer but
watch out you don’t burn it (but the burnt bit just peels off, so no worries).
Eat hot or cold – you can wrap portions in tin foil to use for a packed lunch.
104Cheesy Polenta Bread
This is somewhere between a bread & a savoury cake. Feel free to play around with the extras (eg. herbs, different cheeses, seeds,
nuts!). Makes one 1lb loaf.

100g fine polenta
100g rice flour
1 tsp baking powder
1⁄2 tsp each salt, pepper, ground

250 - 300ml natural yoghurt
50 - 75g grated cheese (cheddar, Red
Leicester etc to taste)
a generous pour each of pumpkin
seeds, sunflower seeds
Heat the oven to 200°C (400°F/GM6) & roast the chopped shallots for 5 - 10
minutes. Alternatively you could just fry them in butter until soft.
Mix the polenta, flour, baking powder & seasoning, then add the egg, olive oil &
yoghurt.
The consistency should be wet but not soggy. Add more polenta if it seems too
sloppy.
Mix in 3⁄4 of the cheese, then add the roasted shallots & seeds to taste.
Transfer to a lined or greased loaf tin & put the rest of the cheese on top.
Bake for 30 - 35 minutes at 200°C (400°F/GM6).

105Apple Mint Chutney
Fills about 6 one pound jars.
**vegan**
Ingredients:Place the chopped apples in a large, stainless steel pan with half a pint of vinegar.
2kg cooking apples, peeled, cored
and chopped
568ml (1 pint) white wine vinegar
500g tomatoes, chopped
4 - 5 chilli peppers, sliced
8 cloves of garlic, chopped
1 red onion, chopped into big chunks
500g soft brown sugar
2 tsp each of ground ginger and
mixed spice
salt, to taste
large handful of roughly chopped
fresh mintHeat up and cook until it is thick and pulpy (leave the lid on, otherwise the vinegar
evaporates before the apples are ready).

Then add the remaining vinegar, tomatoes, chilli pepper, garlic, red onion, sugar,
ground ginger, mixed spice and salt. Mix well and bring up to heat.
Allow to bubble gently for about 30 minutes.
Add the large handful of mint and allow to bubble for another 5 minutes.
Turn the heat off and allow to cool a little (till it has stopped bubbling).
Place into clean jars whilst still hot, and lid.“Traffic Light” Tomato Chutney
This fills approximately 4 one pound jars.
**vegan**
Ingredients:
2.5kg tomatoes, red, green and every
colour in-between, chopped
500g onion, finely chopped
30g salt
500ml red wine vinegar
500ml white wine vinegar
500g soft light brown sugar
1 tbsp each of ground black pepper,
ginger and cumin (or to taste)
2 tsp each of ground cloves and
cinnamon (or to taste)
Chop and wash the tomatoes. Add the finely chopped onion, and sprinkle over the
salt. Mix thoroughly in a large bowl, cover with a cloth or similar and leave
somewhere safe overnight.
The next day, drain away the liquid from the tomatoes and onion, but do not rinse or
wash them.
Pour the vinegars into a large stock pot or similar. Add the sugar and gently heat
until the sugar has fully dissolved into the vinegar.
Add the tomatoes and onion, the black pepper, ginger, cumin, cloves and cinnamon.
Mix well and increase the heat to gently bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Reduce
the heat and allow to cook slowly, stirring occasionally.
The chutney should eventually thicken and turn a dark-golden brown colour and the
volume should reduce to less than half. A good test is to run a wooden spoon across
the bottom of the pan – if the chutney mixture remains divided long enough to see the
bottom of the pan, it’s probably done! The actual cooking time needed will depend on
a). how thick you like your chutney and b). how high the heat is during the cooking!

110Edible Play Dough
This recipe was developed for my son Daniel, who was given a packet of pastry cutters as a present but had nothing to use them
with. The amount below makes a big ball – plenty to divide in two and freeze half for another rainy day!
**vegetarian**
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 190°C (375°F/GM5).
50g potato flour
50g rice flour (plus some for dusting)
100g ground almonds
25g softened butter
25 - 50g sugar
1 tbsp xanthan gum
1⁄2 tsp (or to taste) ground cloves,
cinnamon, nutmeg, almond essence,
vanilla essence
2 eggs
pinch of salt
oil (optional)Mix together the dry ingredients (potato and rice flour, ground almonds, sugar, gum
and salt). Then add the eggs, softened butter and essences/spices. You can make
this in the food processor – just leave it running till the ingredients form one big ball
(or almost!). Alternatively you can easily mix this by hand. If it’s not all coming
together, you can add a little oil to help it along.
Use rice flour to dust the work surface and the rolling pin and off you go! Once the
shapes are cut, place them on a greased and lined baking tray and bake them at
190°C (375°F/GM5) for 10 - 15 minutes – keep an eye on them, since the exact time
needed will depend on how thick or thin the dough has been rolled. It does help if
they are all roughly a similar thickness....
Allow to cool on the tray. These keep well in an air-tight box.

Alternatives -
The spices and essence are only a guide; you could flavour these however you like.
The exact amount and type of flours is flexible, so feel free to use whatever you have
in the cupboard – I know I do!
If your children covet the violently-coloured versions in the shops, try using food
colouring!

cooking apples, peeled, skinned and
sliced
2 tbsp sugar (or to taste)
pinch of ground cinnamon, nutmeg
and cloves
The Topping - blend the butter with 50g ground almonds and 50g rice flour. Pulse
in the sugar. Remove the mixture from the blender into a bowl and add about
another 50g ground almonds, rubbing it in with your fingers until it forms a nice
crumb texture. If the crumbs are too sticky, add more ground almonds. If too dry,
simply add more butter. Alternatively, place all the ground almonds, rice flour, sugar
and butter in a bowl and rub into crumbs with your fingers – messy but it doesn’t
actually take that much longer, and removes the need for a blender.
Layer the crumble mix on top of the fruit and cook at 160°C (325°F/GM3) for about
45 minutes, until the topping is crunchy and golden brown.
Serve with ice cream, cream or custard.
Alternatives -
Apple and pear, apple and blackberry, apple and rhubarb, and just plain rhubarb.

Cheat tip –
If you haven’t made quite enough topping to cover the fruit, just fill the gaps in with
plain ground almonds...no-one will ever know!
117Rice Puddings
Both of these are excellent comfort foods, and both so simple!
Serves 4.
Ingredients:
Classic Rice Pudding
85g pudding rice
568ml (1 pint) milk
30g caster sugar
Classic Rice Pudding
These quantities work for me, I find, but lots of recipes use less rice. Use whatever
works for you. There are 3 ways you can make this. Pick whichever suits you!
1. Place the ingredients in a slow cooker (buttered, if you like) and cook for 2 - 3
hours on low.
2. Place the ingredients in a casserole dish (buttered, if you like) and bake in an oven
at 160 - 180°C (325 - 350°F/GM3 - 4) for 11⁄2 hours.
Ground Rice Pudding
568ml (1 pint) milk
2 tbsp ground rice
1 tbsp sugar (or to taste)
3. If you don’t have hours to let it cook, you can make this on the hob. Put the rice &
sugar in a pan and heat while adding milk slowly until absorbed (like a risotto),
stirring it constantly. It’s not quite as good but it is plenty quicker! Get the pan in
soak as soon as you’ve served up.
For all the above, I recommend regular stirring to avoid milk skin (for this reason I
don’t add nutmeg until serving). Keep the milk bottle to hand - if the milk absorbs
before the rice is cooked, just add more!

Ground Rice Pudding
Mix the rice and sugar into a little of the milk. Bring the rest of the milk nearly to the
boil, then add to the rice/sugar mix. Return to the heat and stir until thickened to a
consistency you like.Vanilla Ice Cream
Makes just over one pint of ice cream.
Ingredients:
1 pint double cream
6 egg yolks
1 tsp vanilla essence
20ml honey
sugar, to taste
Blend all the ingredients up in a food processor and transfer to an ice cream maker.
You can do the freezing with intermittent beating if you don't have an ice cream
maker...
We like it made with honey; about 20ml of liquid honey for the flavour is nice. Add
as much sugar as you need, to suit your taste.
Alternative -
Mango flavour:
Replace the sugar and honey with the flesh of one peeled, ripe mango – the mango
gets placed in the food processor with the other ingredients, before going into the ice
cream maker.

This is really good: simple, fresh and rich - you won’t need much, but may want to
scoff lots!Triple Layer Cheesecake
Makes a 20cm (8 inch) diameter cheesecake.
Ingredients:
The Base –
200g mixed chopped nuts (e.g.
macadamias, almonds, walnuts)
50g butter
25g honey
The Middle -
handful of strawberries (or blueberries)
250g tub of mascarpone

again.
The Middle layer –
Mix together the mascarpone and crème fraîche. Add the vanilla essence and honey.
Layer some sliced strawberries (or blueberries) over the set nut-base, and then
spread the mascarpone/crème fraîche over them.
The Top –
Melt the chocolate. Warm up the cream and then mix it in with the melted chocolate,
and add the butter. Stir well until the mixture is even. Allow it to cool slightly, but
while it is still liquid enough to be self-levelling, pour it on top of the cheesecake.
Place the cheesecake in the fridge and wait for the chocolate topping to set fully.
Decorate the top with strawberries, blueberries or raspberries if you like. We
sometimes coat them in chocolate too.

127Chocolate, Hazelnut & Biscuit Torte
Makes one shallow loaf-tin sized torte.
Ingredients:
The Biscuits –
75g ground almonds
25g each of potato and rice flour
1⁄2 tsp xanthan gum
pinch of salt
25g sugar
12g butter
1⁄2 tsp vanilla essence
1 egg
The Torte -
100ml milk
2 tbsp brandy
100g 70% cocoa chocolate
100g butter
1 tbsp (or to taste) honey
3 egg yolks
50ml double cream
100g chopped hazelnuts
1 tsp vanilla essence
Photo:
see page 126, middle right panel
128
First, make the biscuits -
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
Mix together the dry ingredients: the ground almonds, potato and rice flour, sugar,
gum and salt.
Soften the butter and add it plus the egg into a well in the centre of the dry
ingredients.
Mix it all together, adding the vanilla essence. It should come together as a nice, soft
dough, and form one big ball in your bowl.
Using rice flour to dust your work surface and rolling pin, roll out a quarter of the
dough at a time until it is approximately half a centimetre thick. Cut out circles with a
pastry cutter, and place them on a greased and lined baking tray.
This makes about 22 - 24 biscuits for me, but it depends how thin you make them.
Bake them in the oven for about 15 minutes at 180°C (350°F/GM4) or until golden
brown and hard. The aim is to make biscuits a bit like ‘Rich Tea’ ones. Remove them
from the oven and allow them to cool.To make the torte -
Measure out 150g of the biscuits (there will be a few left over, what a shame...).
Break them into small pieces, mix together the milk and brandy, and pour this over the
biscuit pieces. Mix well, and allow the biscuits to soak up as much liquid as they can
– this can take about an hour for really nice soggy biscuits. Strain away the excess
liquid.
Melt together the chocolate and butter. Allow to cool slightly, then stir in the egg
yolks, mixing really well. Add in the vanilla essence, honey and then the cream – do
this about a third at a time and mix well in between as you don’t want the mixture to
cool and set before you are ready. Add the soaked and drained biscuit pieces and the
chopped hazelnuts and mix well.
Pour this mixture into a greased and lined loaf type tin (or whatever shape you want
the pudding to be).
Place it in the fridge to set, preferably overnight.
Serve in slices.

130Chocolate Polenta Cake
**dairy-free, vegan**
Ingredients:
150g polenta
50g rice flour
250 - 300ml water
2 tbsp honey
1 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp cocoa powder
100g melted chocolate, for topping
ground cinnamon, raisins, cherries (to
taste)

peel (to taste)
Simmer all the ingredients in a saucepan until the water is absorbed and the mixture
comes away easily from the side of the pan.
Add the ground cinnamon, raisins and cherries, or orange rind and mixed spice.
Pour into a greased and/or lined tin and leave to cool (in the fridge if necessary).
Top with melted chocolate.
This cake is quite soft, so added ingredients such as fruit are really good for texture
and flavour!

131Vegan Chocolate Buns
Adapted from a recipe by Dr. Eugenia Cheng, inspirational maths genius and baker.
Makes between 8 and 12 buns.
Ingredients:
110g rice flour
100g caster sugar
50ml olive oil
140ml water
20g cocoa powder
pinch of salt
1 tsp baking powder
**dairy-free, vegan**
Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4). Place bun cases into a muffin tin (so they
don’t spread too wide).
Mix all the ingredients together and divide into the bun cases. Bake for about 15
minutes.
Preferably eat warm and crispy, straight from the oven....
Alternatives -
You can also make this into a cake by increasing the ingredients up to 1.5 times the
size (i.e. 165g flour, etc). Bigger than that & it collapses very easily.
Choc-nut Terrine -
I made a cake (as above, but too big!) for a wedding reception & it collapsed around
me but tasted fantastic, so I stirred in some warmed syrup & chopped nuts,
squashed it into a loaf tin & wanged it in the fridge. I am now the proud creator of a
delicious choc-nut terrine!
Surprise Buns -
Fill the bun cases only halfway and bake for 8 - 10 minutes until a little bit stiff.
Then add a spoonful of chocolate spread and carefully cover with the rest of the
mixture. Return to the oven to finish off. You can also do this with jam in the apricot
buns recipe (see page 139).
132Chocolate Brownies
Makes 9 - 16 squares.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
50g chocolate (70% cocoa)
50g Maya Gold chocolate (Green
and Blacks)
100g butter
100g ground almonds
75 - 150g sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp vanilla essence
2 eggs (large)
pinch of saltMelt the chocolates with the butter either in a glass bowl over a pan of simmering
water, or in a microwave (medium setting, stir every minute, do not over heat). Then
add the ground almonds, sugar, baking powder, vanilla, eggs, and salt. Mix well.
chocolate chips for the top (optional)
walnut pieces (optional)
Pour the mixture into a greased and lined baking tin approximately 18cm square.
Place in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F/GM4) for 30 minutes. Remove from the
tin whilst still hot and sprinkle with the chocolate chips. Allow to cool. Cut into
squares, and eat!
Alternatives -
There is a huge range of sugar for this recipe. The sugar is responsible for the
crisp top characteristic of brownies, so if you like sweet cakes and want the top to
be brownie-like, you need to use a lot of sugar. However, we have found you can
reduce the sugar to your taste and still have a delicious cake at the end so it’s really
up to you....
You can also add chopped walnut pieces.

133Chocolate and Cointreau Cake
Makes 1 cake. How many it serves is up to you...
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Cake -
50g Maya Gold chocolate (Green
and Blacks)
50g chocolate (70 - 85% cocoa)
100g butter
3 eggs
2 tbsp Cointreau
100g ground almonds
75 - 100g sugarThe Cake -
Melt the chocolates with the butter either in a glass bowl over a pan of simmering
water, or in a microwave (medium setting, stir every minute, do not over heat). Then
add the ground almonds, sugar, Cointreau and eggs. Mix together and divide into
two round, approximately 18cm, greased and lined cake tins. Cook for 20 - 25
minutes at 180°C (350°F/GM4). Allow to cool thoroughly before icing and don’t
worry, they will be flat!
The Topping -
50g Maya Gold chocolate (Green
and Blacks)
50g chocolate (70 - 85% cocoa)
100g butter
2 tbsp Cointreau
Photo:
see page 136, top right panel
134
The Topping -
Melt the chocolates and the butter as before. Add in the 2 tbsp Cointreau and mix
well. Allow to cool until it is the correct consistency for spreading – you can put it in
the fridge (or even the freezer!) to speed up the process, but do give it a thorough
mix every 5 - 10 minutes. Use approximately one third to sandwich the two cakes
together, and use the remainder to coat the top, with a little round the sides too.
Alternatives -
You can use different liqueurs, for example rum or whiskey.
You can double the quantities for an extra large cake and it still works perfectly –
but double the quantities for the topping too.Tiffin-like Cake
So named because the first time Ken tasted it, he declared "its almost like Tiffin". The full proper name for this cake is really
The Almost-Like-Tiffin Cake.
Ingredients:
The Base -
110g chocolate (70 - 90% cocoa)
100g chopped roasted hazelnuts
120g walnut pieces
75 - 100g sugar
1 tbsp honey
1⁄2 an orange-worth of finely
chopped orange peel
30ml brandy
3 eggs
cinnamon, nutmeg and ground
cloves, to taste
1⁄2 tsp each of vanilla essence &
orange essence
The Topping –
100g chocolate (70% cocoa)
100g butter
double cream
mixed spice, to taste
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Base -
Blitz the chocolate, hazelnuts and walnut pieces in a food processor until you have
small pieces (not all crumbs). Then add the sugar, honey, orange peel, brandy, eggs,
cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, vanilla essence & orange essence (chopped
cherries and dates if using, optional but nice). Mix well and pack down into a large
(about 20cm) round, greased and lined tin, preferably one with a removable rim.
Bake at 180°C (350°F/GM4) for around 40 minutes then allow to cool thoroughly.
The Topping -
Melt the butter and chocolate together. Add the double cream and mixed spice. Pour
this over the base and leave to set in the fridge.
Alternatives -
Top the base with fresh raspberries & a pot of mascarpone (sweeten to taste with
icing sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla essence) for a cheesecake alternative.

135136Oil Spice Cake
This is adapted from my mum's chocolate cake recipe. The oil & syrup keep it moist - don’t be stingy with the syrup!
**can be made lactose-free**
Ingredients:Line a cake tin with greaseproof paper & pre-heat the oven to 160°C (325°F/GM3).
150g rice flour
2 tbsp ground mixed spice
(or your own spice mix to taste)
2 tsp baking powder
125g sugar
2 eggs
2 tbsp golden syrup
142ml (1⁄4 pint) vegetable oil
142ml (1⁄4 pt) milk
(lactose-free if required: works just as
well)Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. Whisk the wet ingredients thoroughly then add
these to the bowl of dry ingredients. Whisk together really well & pour into the cake
tin.
Photo:
see page 136, middle left panel
Bake for at least 45 minutes - check very carefully! Don't test it with a skewer as
this will make it collapse if it isn't ready! Instead gently prod the top to see how it
feels - if it goes ‘wrong’ you’ll just have to make another one ‘to practise’. Damn and
blast.
This works nicely filled with apple & cinnamon jelly (see Christmas section, page
170) and/or plain glacé icing on top, perhaps with walnuts or chopped stem ginger.
It’s also delicious as is, of course!
Alternatives -
Swap the spice for 2 tbsp cocoa powder for a chocolate cake. I usually fill the
chocolate version with half a jar of jam (raspberry, blackcurrant or bramble all
work beautifully) and some chocolate hazelnut spread for extra indulgence (check
it’s gluten-free) & pour melted chocolate on the top.
137Lemon Cake
Only for those who really like their lemons.
**dairy-free cake**
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Cake -
3 lemons
3 large eggs
150 - 225g caster sugar
1 tsp baking powder
240g ground almondsThe Cake -
Scrub the lemons, place in a saucepan and cover with water. Leave to simmer for 1
hour, checking regularly. Add more water if it gets low.
The Topping –
50g caster or icing sugar (or to taste)
225 - 250g mascarpone (1 pot)
grated rind and juice of 1 lime
Halve the lemons and remove the pips. Place the fruit in a food processor and blend
to a pureé. Mix in the eggs, sugar, baking powder and almonds. Pour the mixture
into a greased and lined cake tin (18cm) and bake at 180°C (350°F/GM4) for 1 hour.
Allow to cool.
The Topping -
Mix all the ingredients together and stick it on the cake!
Alternatives -
Substitute 2 large oranges for the lemons, but make sure they are very tasty ones
or you’ll not get the right kick of flavour.

This cake recipe is **dairy-free** (i.e. no butter) so change the topping for one
based on icing sugar mixed with lime juice and water, or even easier, just sprinkle
some icing sugar on top for a dairy-free and gluten-free cake.Aunty Karla's Apricot and Almond Cakes

The Cake -
Place the walnuts with the ground almonds in a food processor and blitz until the
walnut pieces have turned to a similar consistency to the almonds – some small
chunks is fine, and you will have some darker flecks from the walnut skins too (see
photo on page 142, middle right panel). Place in a bowl and add the melted butter,
sugar, baking powder and eggs. Mix well. Mix in the water and/or oil a bit at a time,
until it is all added. Divide the mixture between two round, 18cm greased and lined
baking tins and bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F/GM4) for 25 minutes,
until golden brown on top. Remove and allow to cool in the tins.

the cake and down the sides. Finish off with some whole walnuts to decorate the
top.
141142Carrot Cake
For Zoë.
**can be dairy-free**
Ingredients:
The Cake –
175g carrot, finely grated
50g desiccated coconut
100g brown sugar
75g rice flour
25g ground almonds
50g raisins
90ml oil
2 eggs
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1⁄2 tsp nutmeg
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp vanilla essence
1 tsp orange essence
The Icing –
75g butter, softened
25g icing sugar (or to taste)
25g soft cream cheese
zest of 1⁄2 an orange
1 tsp orange essence
Photo:
see previous page, middle left panel
Preheat the oven to 190°C (375°F/GM5).
The Cake -
Mix together the grated carrot, coconut, sugar, rice flour, ground almonds and
raisins in a large bowl. Then add the oil and the eggs, mixing well. Add the
remaining ingredients: vanilla and orange essence, ground cinnamon, nutmeg and
baking powder. Mix together really thoroughly, then place the mixture into a square,
greased and lined tin. Bake for 25 minutes at 190°C (375°F/GM5). Remove from the
tin and allow to cool.
The Icing -
Mix together the butter and cream cheese, then sift in the icing sugar and
incorporate it into the butter cheese. How much you use is up to you and how
sweet you like your icing, but beware – you can overdo it! Add the orange zest and
essence, check the taste. Once your cake is thoroughly cooled, spread the icing all
over the top.
Alternatives -
This cake can be made dairy-free if you change the icing for one based on water
and icing sugar, rather than butter and cream cheese. Also this cake is nice and
moist as it is, so it’s rather good without any icing at all.
143Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Cookies
Makes 16 cookies.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F/GM3).
50g butter
100g ground almonds
25g crunchy peanut butter
30 - 50g sugar
1⁄2 tsp baking powder
1 egg yolk
dark chocolate chipsMelt the butter. Mix together with the ground almonds, melted butter, crunchy
peanut butter, egg yolk, sugar and baking powder. The mixture should form a big
ball. Add a handful of dark chocolate chips.
Roll into about 16 little balls, and place them onto a baking tray lined with grease
proof paper. Flatten the balls very slightly with a fork. Doing this at right angles
makes the nice criss-cross pattern on top.
Bake these at 160°C (325°F/GM3) for 20 minutes. They do expand a little in size
when baked.
Allow to cool before lifting them from tray.
If they're too flat when they go in the oven, they just splurge outwards into thin,
large and flat things! And then catch at the edges...

1 egg yolk (large)
1⁄2 tsp baking powder
25g dark chocolate chipsMix the melted butter with the ground almonds, sugar, baking powder and egg yolk.
Mix well, until it starts to form a big ball.
Add the hazelnuts and orange essence and mix well again. Stir in the chocolate
chips.
Divide the mixture into 16, roll into little balls and place on a greased, lined baking
tray. Don’t flatten.
Bake in a preheated oven at 160°C (325°F/GM3) for 20 minutes.
Allow to cool on the tray.
Stored in an airtight container these will stay nice and crispy (if they don’t all get
eaten first!).

145Biscuits for Grown-ups
This recipe is a good basic one for biscuits, feel free to chop and change the flavours. Some examples of alternative flavours are
given on the next page. Makes 16 biscuits.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F/GM3).
The Basic Biscuit Mix –
70g butter, melted
35g sugar
1 egg yolk
1⁄2 tsp baking powder
100g ground almondsMelt the butter, and then add the sugar, ground almonds, egg yolk and baking
powder. Mix well until the dough forms a ball in your bowl. This is your basic
starting point – now you can add whatever flavours you like!
Grown-up Flavours -
1 tsp lime juice
zest of 1⁄2 lime, finely grated or
chopped
1⁄2 tsp dried red chilli, very finely
chopped
30g dark chocolate chips
For the ‘grown-up biscuits’ add the lime zest, lime juice, chilli and dark chocolate
chips (if your melted butter has warmed the dough up, beware adding the chips
before it has cooled again, I’ve managed on several occasions to melt my choc chips.
Still taste delicious, but not quite as pretty!).
Mix well, and then divide the mixture into 16 equal sized pieces (into four, and then
each quarter into four again makes it nice and easy to judge). Roll each into a ball in
your hands, then place them on a greased and lined baking tray. Do not squash the
balls – they will flatten out slightly as they bake.
Bake in the oven at 160°C (325°F/GM3) for 20 minutes. Allow to cool on the tray
before handling.
146Cherry, Coconut and Almond Biscuits
Start with the basic biscuit recipe then add flaked almonds (toasted if desired) &
chopped glace cherries to taste. Easy.
Photo: see page 136, bottom right panel
Chocolate & Ginger Biscuits
Follow the basic biscuit recipe except replace the sugar with brown sugar (35g), and
add approximately 1 tsp ground ginger and some stem ginger cut into chunks (amount
to taste) together with the chocolate chips. If you mix all the ingredients together in a
pan on the hob, the chocolate will melt in, making the biscuit itself chocolaty: if you do
it off the hob, stir in the chocolate last & the chips should retain their shape.
Honey, Almond and Ginger Biscuits
The only change to the basic biscuit recipe is to swap sugar for honey. Then add
some lumps of stem ginger (to taste), some flaked almonds and 1 tsp almond essence.

148Christmas Menus & Ideas
Just a few ideas for festive feasting...
For Christmas Day itself, we’ve decided not to provide recipes so
much as a suggested menu and advice (having said that, read on for
chestnut soup recipe & others). There are endless places that can
help with the roast itself, and so many people have their own roast
recipes that we couldn’t face adding ourselves to the list. Pick
whatever meat you want, but be sure to keep the juices, then thicken
them with cornflour for your gravy. Add wine if you like (a dash of
orange juice works well with duck, too), and cook it down to the
consistency you want. Have whatever sides you fancy!
We’ve also decided not to provide a recipe for gluten-free Christmas
pudding. For this, give yourself the preparation-time off and buy one:
most supermarkets do perfectly satisfactory gluten-free puds now.
Boxing Day buffet - most of these can be prepared (or just bought) in
advance, so you shouldn’t feel too rushed on the day! We made the
whole lot and quite frankly it was enough to see 8 of us through the
whole day’s eating.

153Chestnut Soup
If you can find them, use pre-packaged chestnuts - they won’t need any peeling with the seemingly inevitable finger-burning. If you
can’t find them (try the stuffing section of the supermarket), use slightly more fresh ones. Serves 6 - 8.
Ingredients:Fry the onions in oil or butter for a few minutes.
370g pre-packaged chestnuts
1 medium onion, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped
1 litre vegetable stock
1⁄2 cooking apple, diced
cream & seasoning, to tasteAdd the stock, carrot & chestnuts, and simmer for 25 minutes.
Add the apple for a further 5 minutes or so.
Liquidize the whole lot, and then add cream and seasoning to taste.
Return to the heat, just to heat the cream through, and then serve.

154Smoked Salmon Tartlets
A top tip for this is to buy the packs of smoked salmon trimmings: saves a whole load of ripping!
Makes 12 little tartlets.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Savoury pastry -
75g potato flour
75g rice flour
75g ground almonds
salt, to taste
1 tbsp xanthan gum
1 egg
50g butter
olive oilThe Savoury pastry –
See 3 Colour Tartlets recipe, page 76.
The Filling –
100g smoked salmon
150g cream cheese
salt and pepper, to taste
chives, ripped, to taste
grated cheddar, to top
Blind bake the pastry for 10 minutes at 180°C (350°F/GM4). Remove from oven,
coat the pastry with egg wash and return to the oven for 2 minutes.
The Filling -
Mix the filling ingredients (except the grated cheddar) & fill the pastry cases. Bake
for about 15 minutes, then top with the cheddar for a further 5 minutes or so, until
the cheddar turns a bit crispy.
You can serve these warm or cold. Good for finger buffets.

155Nutty-base Smoked Salmon Quiche
Buy smoked salmon trimmings for this if you want to save some chopping time!
Makes a 20cm (8 inch) diameter quiche.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Nutty-base –
50g chopped almonds
50g mixed chopped nuts
50g ground almonds
2 eggs
30g melted butter
pinch of salt
1 tbsp xanthan gumThe Base -
Mix together the nuts with the melted butter, eggs, salt and xanthan gum. Use a tin
approximately 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter (preferably with a removable base),
grease the tin and line with grease-proof paper. Pack the nut mix firmly into the base
and bake for 15 minutes at 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Topping -
150g smoked salmon
150g grated cheddar
350ml (12 fl oz) double cream
4 eggs
salt & pepper, to taste
chives, to taste
1 ball mozzarella, in 1cm cubes
The Topping -
Place the salmon & mozzarella onto the precooked nut base. Sprinkle the grated
cheddar over. Mix together the double cream, eggs, chives and seasoning to taste.
Pour this mixture over the salmon and mozzarella. Bake at 180°C (350°F/GM4) for
a further 50 - 60 minutes, until golden brown on top. Place a tray underneath to
catch any drips!
You can serve this warm or cold and the firm base means it makes good finger food.
It also keeps well.

157Smoked Mackerel Pate
Serves many.
Ingredients:Flake the fish
equal weights of smoked mackerel
fillet & cream cheeseMix well with the cream cheese.
Add seasoning & lemon juice to taste.
seasoning & lemon juice, to taste
That's it.
Lovely served as part of a buffet platter.
Nice with chopped salad vegetables such as carrot or peppers,
or on rice cakes or gluten-free crackers.

158Sausagemeat Stuffing
Very easy to make and works well either as a stuffing for turkey or rolled into little balls and baked in the oven.
Makes approximately 1kg.
Ingredients:
450g gluten-free sausagemeat
(or gluten-free pork sausages with the
skins removed)
400g pork mince
1 red onion, finely diced
olive oil
4 cloves of garlic, crushed
salt and pepper, to taste
1⁄2 tsp ground nutmeg
2 sage leaves, very finely chopped
(or 1 - 2 tsp dried sage)
60g cranberries, dried, sweetened
50g ground almonds
2 eggs
Fry the red onion in the olive oil with the garlic until slightly brown. Leave to fully
cool.
Place the sausagemeat in a large bowl and break it up into small chunks. Add the
pork mince and mix well (by hand).
Then add the cranberries, red onion, sage, nutmeg and seasoning. Mix well.
Beat the eggs and then add them to the mixture with the ground almonds. Mix well.
The mixture will start to come together into a large ball.
Either stuff this into the turkey immediately prior to roasting or use it to make
individual stuffing balls. Take about a dessert spoon of stuffing, roll into a ball and
place on a greased and lined baking tray. Bake in the oven at 180°C (350°F/GM4)
for about 20 minutes.

Sausagemeat stuffing balls
159Snowball Pudding
This is adapted from a recipe my mother makes every year. If you have company visiting, I recommend making double the quantities
(see photo) for a three-layer, enormous pudding to impress everyone! This smaller version serves 4 well.
Ingredients:
For the sponge -
70g butter
85g sugar
1 egg & 1 yolk
55g rice flour
25g ground almonds
1 tsp baking powder
1⁄2 tsp xanthan gum
1⁄2 tbsp milk
1⁄2 tsp vanilla essence
For the pudding -
100g cream cheese
2 tsp caster sugar (optional)
40g melted butter
25g chopped hazelnuts
approx 2 tsp mixed peel
25g chopped glace cherries (plus
extra to decorate)
25g chopped stem ginger
rind and juice of 1 orange & 1⁄2 lemon
1 packet gelatine
150ml whipping cream
160
Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (130°F/GM4).
Mix all the sponge ingredients & bake in a lined 18cm sandwich tin. Allow to cool,
then slice the cake in half (to make 2 very thin sponges).
Mix the cream cheese, sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the nuts, peel,
cherries, ginger & rind of the orange & lemon. Grease the inside of a pudding bowl.
Line the bowl with the sponge cake (as if you were making an apple Charlotte: see
photos next page). Now fill the bowl, alternating the cream cheese mix & sponge
cake. Finish with sponge cake. Expect to get two layers of each, or three if you make
double. With a skewer, prick lots of holes all the way through the pudding.
Mix the gelatine according to the instructions. Add to the citrus juice, then pour the
whole lot carefully over the pudding until it all sinks in through the skewer holes.
Place in the fridge overnight (it will keep fine for an extra day if you want to make it
on Christmas Eve for serving on Boxing Day).
The next day, carefully turn the pudding out of the bowl. Cover liberally with
whipped cream, sweetened if you really fancy it-but believe me, there’s plenty going
on in the rest of the pud. If you like, decorate with halved glace cherries.
This is quite a rich pudding and not to everyone’s tastes, but it is worth the faff
involved in making it!Mince Pies
Makes 12 deep-fill type pies or 20 shallow-fill ones.
Ingredients:Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
The Sweet Pastry -
150g rice flour
150g ground almonds
2 tsp xanthan gum
pinch of salt
50g sugar
150g butter, cubed
1 eggCombine the rice flour, ground almonds, xanthan gum, salt and sugar and mix well.
Then add the egg and butter. If the pastry seems too dry, add a small amount of
water at a time and keep mixing it well until it forms a nice, solid ball. If it seems too
wet, add more flour. In my hands gluten-free pastry always seems quite moist
compared to the gluten-full variety. Leave it to rest for 30 - 60 minutes in the fridge.
1 jar gluten-free mince meat
rice flour for dusting
egg, to brush
icing sugar to dust (optional)
Photo:
see page 168, central panel
see page 151, right panel
162
Roll out the pastry - leave it fairly thick when rolling it out, as gluten-free pastry will
never be as elastic as pastry with gluten in. Flour your work surface well with rice
flour (or roll out your pastry between two sheets of grease-proof paper). Be patient –
you can always make the ball again and re-roll if you get holes...
Cut circles of pastry with a cutter (or anything round that's the right size!). Handle
the pastry circles carefully, ease them into place in a 12-hole deep fill tin (one for
muffins is ideal), gently push them into the holes and mould them into place. Fill each
one with ample mince meat.
Use any remaining pastry to make little lids or cut out shapes to decorate the top of
the pies (optional). Brush the pastry with a little beaten egg and cook in the oven at
180°C (350°F/GM4) for 25 – 30 minutes. Decorate with a little icing sugar once
they are cooled (optional).Brandy Butter
Perfect with mince pies or Christmas pudding - in fact, in a fit of desperation my sister once removed the icing from a piece of
Christmas cake & microwaved it, just as an excuse to have some brandy butter!
Ingredients:Whisk the butter & icing sugar together well, as if making butter icing.
(all quantities to taste)Add brandy to taste (don’t let it get too wet - if it does, add more icing sugar).
roughly equal quantities of butter &
icing sugar
brandyChill before serving.
163Vanilla Kipferl
These are adapted from a traditional German recipe. They’re good cold but particularly fine just out of the oven, warm and crispy.
Makes approximately 14 crescents.
Ingredients:Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (350°F/GM4).
100g ground almonds
140g rice flour
vanilla essence
60g sugar
120g butter
icing sugar/ground cinnamon to dust
(optional)Mix all the ingredients together to make a dough. If it falls apart too easily, add some
olive oil.
Divide into 14 or 15, and carefully shape into crescents.
Place on a greased baking tray and bake for about 15 minutes.
Allow to cool slightly before moving onto a plate, then dust slightly with icing sugar
and/or cinnamon, if desired.

164Chocolate-coated Marzipan
A very simple recipe which uses about a quarter the normal amount of sugar – feel free to increase if you have an especially sweet
tooth. Coat with flavoured chocolate for extra special marzipan.
Ingredients:Sift the icing and caster sugar into a bowl. Add the ground almonds and mix.
150g ground almonds
25g caster sugar
50g icing sugar
1 egg
1 – 2 tbsp almond essence
2 tsp vanilla essence
icing sugar, for rolling out
chocolate to coatAdd the egg and the almond and vanilla essences. Mix well; the marzipan should
come into a ball. If it is too wet, add a little more icing sugar (or ground almonds if
you don’t want to increase the sweetness). Adding more vanilla essence or perhaps
a little honey will increase the flavour without the need for more sugar.
Cut a piece of grease-proof paper out and fold it in half. Unfold it again, and dust the
inner surface with a little icing sugar. Place a small ball of marzipan on the paper
and fold it so the marzipan is in the middle. Press down with your hands to flatten
the ball, until it is 1 - 2cm thick. Unfold the paper, and use pastry cutters to cut out
shapes from the marzipan. Place these on a grease-proof paper lined plate. Repeat
this until all the marzipan has been cut into shapes. Dust the paper with icing sugar
each time a new ball is flattened out. Place the shapes in the fridge for about an hour.
Melt the chocolate either in the microwave or using a bain-marie. Allow to cool a
little, before placing each marzipan into the chocolate and turning it until well coated
(I find forks the most useful for this). Place the coated shapes on a fresh piece of
grease-proof paper, on another plate. Once they are all coated, allow the chocolate to
set by leaving them in a cool place.

see page 151, right panel
Using flavoured chocolates works well for this – my favourite is Green and Blacks
ginger flavour chocolate...
165Zimtsterne - Cinnamon Stars
Makes approximately 25-30 biscuits.
Ingredients:
2 egg whites
150g icing sugar
200g ground almonds
2 tsp ground cinnamon
zest of 1⁄2 lemon
1 tsp rum
Whisk the egg whites till they're really stiff, then add the sugar a spoon at a time.
Put aside about 2 tablespoons of the resultant mix into a separate bowl for later.
Stir in the almonds, cinnamon & lemon zest to make a dough. Roll out the dough to
anything up to 5mm thick & cut out as many star shapes as you can. The dough is
quite sticky, so it's important that when you roll it out you do so between 2 sheets of
greaseproof paper. Place the stars onto baking trays lined with greaseproof paper.
Now, pre-heat the oven to 160°C (325°F/GM3).
Stir the rum into the egg and sugar mix you set aside, then paint it onto each star.
Bake for about 15 - 20 minutes & leave to cool before removing from the baking
trays.
Alternatives -
You could use these little biscuits (if fairly thin) as tops for mince pies - they'll look
pretty, but there won't be that 'too much pastry' thing you often get with mince pies.
The first time I made this I had no cinnamon so used mixed spice: it works pretty
well so feel free to experiment with flavours.

see page 151, bottom left panel
166Spiced Biscuits
Makes approximately 15 biscuits.
Ingredients:Pre-heat oven to 160°C (325°F/GM3).
70g melted butter
35g sugar
1 egg yolk
1⁄2 tsp baking powder
100g ground almonds
1 tsp mixed spice
1⁄2 tsp ground clovesMix all the ingredients together and form into approximately 15 balls.
Place on a lined baking tray & bake for 20 minutes.
Allow to cool before transferring to a plate.

167Nuts for Nibbling
No quantities for these recipes as it really is a case of whatever suits your taste.
Sweet & Spicy Cashews
plain cashew nuts
butter
cinnamon
paprika
brown sugar
see previous page, bottom middle panel
Heat up the butter in a flat-bottomed pan. Throw in all other ingredients & toss the
nuts until well-coated and slightly caramelised. Allow to cool before serving.
Salted Almonds
whole almonds
butter
salt
see previous page, top right panel
As above but with salt. Alternatively, bake at 160°C (325°F/GM3) for 10 minutes, then
coat with olive oil & add salt, then cook for another 5 minutes or so. Pat off the oil &
allow to cool a little.
Salt & Pepper Cashews

As above (either hob or oven), but grind salt & pepper on.Apple & Cinnamon Jelly
This is my Christmas jam - it makes a great homemade present. The recipe works equally well for jellies made with apples alone, and
also with blackberries, raspberries etc. Makes approximately 5 x 1lb jars.
Ingredients:
4lb apples
3 pints of water
ground cinnamon to taste
(I use about one sixth of a jar)
jam sugar: 1 lb to 1 pint syrup
(see recipe)
Photo:
see page 168, middle right panel
170
Roughly chop the apples. Simmer to a mush in a saucepan. Strain the fruit overnight
using a jelly bag.
The next day, discard the fruit pulp. Measure the resultant syrup & measure out the
jam sugar accordingly (1lb jam sugar to 1pt syrup). Pour the sugar into a large, flat-
bottomed pan and add the cinnamon. Stir the cinnamon in thoroughly at this stage
then add the syrup (if you add the cinnamon after the syrup you will have lumps of
cinnamon).
Boil the sugar & syrup - obviously, be very careful & don’t let children in the kitchen
in this stage! After a few minutes on a rolling boil, put a small spoonful of the jelly
onto a saucer and push it with a fingernail: when the jelly crinkles when pushed, it
will set & is ready to be put into jars.
Hints -
Don’t waste time peeling the apples - they’re going through a jelly bag later, which
will catch the peel.
For these quantities, use two large saucepans with 2lb fruit & 1.5 pints water in each
for the first stage.
If you don’t have a jelly bag stand, then use an upturned stool or chair & pin the jelly
bag to the feet.
When pouring, if you have a heatproof pouring jug, pour the jelly into this then into
the jars. If not, use a ladle and wear rubber gloves.Eierpunsch
This is like drinking boozy custard. It’s the first drink I go for at a German Christmas market, & an essential of my Christmas! One
mug goes far enough, though-beware overindulgence! Makes 1 litre.
Ingredients:
4 eggs
110g sugar
1 tsp vanilla essence
4 cloves
pinch cinnamon
250ml strong black tea, left to cool
juice of 1 lemon
1 bottle white wine (doesn’t need to
be particularly good wine)
whipping cream to serve
Whisk the eggs & sugar with a little of the wine. Add the rest of the ingredients
(except the cream) and heat GENTLY on the stove, stirring constantly (we don’t want
the eggs to scramble), and without allowing it to boil.
Whip the cream until stiff enough to sit on the top of a mug full of liquid. (Do this
before the above instructions if you’re on your own - if not, get someone else to do it
while you heat the drink.)
Remove the drink from the heat & remove the cloves. Pour into mugs & top with the
cream. Provide a spoon (or a straw, if you have no shame...like me).

171Mulled Wine
Do you have some cheap red wine that needs help to be made palatable? You can make your own mulled wine. If you’re particularly
childish (and amused by bad hairstyles), you can learn the following joke: ‘What do we do with cheap red wine?’ ’Mullet!!’ Hoho, etc.
172
Ingredients:Gently heat the ingredients together in a pan until warm and fragrant.
1 bottle red wine
1 orange, into which stick a handful of
cloves
1 piece cinnamon stick
a splash of orange juice (optional)
sugar, to serveServe with sugar to taste.
If serving in glasses, insert a teaspoon before serving to avoid the glass cracking.
Alternatives -
Add a dash of brandy or fruit liqueur to punch it up a bit.Ginger Punch
Ginger wine is fairly readily available these days, both alcoholic & alcohol-free. Adjust the quantities according to taste and the
potency of the wine! Serves 6 - 8.
**can be alcohol-free**
Ingredients:Mix together the honey, juices & ginger wine.
75ml runny honey
juice of 2 lemons
150ml orange juice
70ml ginger wine
1l bottle ginger ale
300ml sparkling waterLeave in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
Before serving, dilute with the ginger ale & sparkling water to taste.

173Chapter 12 - Useful Information
174The Gluten-free Day
Sometimes it’s not recipes you want, but ideas! Some meals
are trickier than others, and sometimes you just need a
prod in the right direction. So here are some suggestions
for times other than when you’re cooking a main course.
175BREAKFAST IDEAS
1. Bacon & Eggs
Eggs are so wonderfully versatile, quick to prepare and very good for you. Try
them fried, poached, boiled, scrambled...for a full English breakfast, just add fried
mushrooms, grilled tomatoes and gluten-free sausages.
2. Omelette or Scrambled Eggs
Try filling the omelette with grated cheese, goat’s cheese, diced ham or even
mushrooms in a soft cheese sauce.
3. Farmer’s Breakfast
Fry some onion, bacon bits, leftover potatoes, then add an egg & scramble.
4. Poached Smoked Haddock
5. Quinoa Porridge
Boil the quinoa for 7-8 minutes, then stir in cream or milk, then add honey, raisins,
pumpkin seeds to taste.
6. Yoghurts
Serve over berries, nuts, seeds to taste. Easy to make your own yoghurt at home
too!
7. Fruit
176LUNCH IDEAS
1. Soup in a Thermos
Try out these recipes – sweet potato and coconut soup (page 90), butternut
squash and chilli soup (page 91), tomato soup with a kick (page 92), blue cheese
and mushroom soup (page 94) and Greek vegetable soup (page 95). Don’t forget
your spoon!
2. Salads
Some simple suggestions... onto a base of mixed green leaves of your choice try
adding:
‘Greek’ salad – cubes of feta, diced red pepper, cucumber, green olives, fresh
thyme, black pepper and drizzles of balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
Chicken and Bacon – fry some streaky bacon until nice and crisp. Chop it up and
mix with left over chicken meat and a generous dollop of mayonnaise.
Egg, Cheese and Bacon – fry some streaky bacon until nice and crisp, then chop it
up. Hard boil some eggs (8 minutes), then cool, peel and slice. Cut some cheddar
into cubes. Mix all these together with a generous dollop of mayonnaise.
Tuna Mayo – drain the tuna, mix with a generous dollop of mayonnaise and
season well with black pepper. Add some tinned sweet corn, diced green pepper
and/or some celery for a change.
3. Rice crackers or rice cakes
Have them with a thick layer of butter with cheese and chutney (pages 106 &
107), or ham or salami. Spread them with the butter and then wrap them up well
in cling-film and/or an airtight box to keep them nice and crisp till lunchtime
(otherwise they very easily go soggy). Keep the cheese and meat separate from
the rice cakes till it’s time to eat them.
1774. Cheese biscuits (pages 112 & 113)
5. Spanish Tortilla (page 104)
6. Quiches (pages 41, 79, 157)
7. Cheesy Polenta Bread (page 105)
8. Onigiri
Sushi rice balls. Cook the rice, add a dash of sushi vinegar, then form them into
balls. Flavour suggestions: fill with tuna or fish flakes; wrap in seaweed sheets;
brush a little miso paste or soy onto the outside & lightly fry or grill before
chilling.
9. Leftovers!
If you’ve made too much of something the night before, pop it into a box or tub &
take it to work - this is especially useful if you have access to a microwave, of
course.
10. Yoghurts e.g. Greek yoghurt, with fresh berries such as strawberries,
blueberries, raspberries.
11. Simple selection of cheeses, cooked meats, salami and boiled eggs, dried fruits
and nuts.
178Hidden Gluten
We’ve all been caught out from time to time: this is a list of
foods you might not expect to contain gluten, but beware!
Most of these were discovered the hard way....make sure
you keep checking the labels, as I'm still finding hidden
gluten in unexpected places!
179Baking powder: gluten-free is available

180Other Names For Gluten
Reading ingredients lists on any processed foods should
become routine to you if you follow a gluten-free diet, but
manufacturers can call gluten by many other names.

Amazing!The Technical Bit: Why is Gluten
So Bad For So Many of Us?
We thought we’d ask Peter to add a little explanation of the
technical side of things here. Please don't feel you have to
read this bit - it’s simply here for your information if you
want it.
If you would like even more, including detailed discussions
and debates covering various aspects of alternative
nutrition, you can find Peter’s blog at:
http://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com/
1831. GLUTEN AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
a) Leaky Gut
Our gut is lined by a layer of cells with two roles: to aid the absorption of our food
and to keep our semi-digested gut contents separate from the rest of our body and
our immune system. Gluten, and in particular wheat germ agglutinin, opens up the
normally miniscule and tightly regulated gaps between these cells. This opening
of gaps allows substances never normally "seen" by our immune system (known
as “foreign”) to pass into the rest of our body, including food particles and normal
gut bacteria.
When this happens, the immune system can now “see” these foreign substances
from within the gut contents and will respond to them with an inflammatory
response. Resulting symptoms can be localised to the gut itself, giving a mixture
of diarrhoea, constipation and cramping, or predispose to distant injury as in the
autoimmune diseases.
184b) Autoimmune Diseases
As discussed previously, gluten can result in a marked inflammatory response
within the gut. In the immunological war-zone which the gut lining subsequently
becomes, it is even possible for your own body tissues to become targeted by the
immune response. If an antibody produced against a foreign target accidentally
locks on to normal tissues, the normal tissue will then be labelled as foreign and
will also be targeted by the immune response. A process of self-attack can then
start and an "auto-immune" disease is established (one where the immune system
attacks your own normal body tissues).
An example of this is a molecule called tissue transglutaminase (tTg) which is part
of the normal repair system within your body; under the conditions described
above, the immune system can start to “see” tTg as a foreign molecule and
produce antibodies directed against it (these antibodies are also one of the current
hallmarks of coeliac disease). The consequences of this can be seen in other
locations in addition to the gut. For example, if the immune system targets cardiac
tTg (located in the heart rather than in the gut) this can result in a certain type of
heart failure, due to the immune system attacking cardiac muscle. Most patients
with this condition may well also have undiagnosed coeliac disease.
The list of auto-immune diseases associated with coeliac disease is very long.
There are reputed to be 22 types of arthritis alone, together with thyroid damage,
clotting cell (platelets) damage, nerve damage and vitiligo (a skin condition).
185c) “Stress” Response in the Gut
Gluten fragments have an additional ability to trigger an immunological "stress"
response. As part of a normal immunological pathway, cells under certain types of
stress display a molecular marker known as MIC on their surface. The MIC is
directly detected by immune cells and the stressed cell is subsequently destroyed,
without the need for antibodies. For example, a virus-infected cell will produce
MIC to signal its infection to the immune system, ensuring it and the virus it
contains are promptly removed from the body.
It is well recognised that the gut-lining cells of untreated coeliac patients display
MIC on their surface, which disappears with gluten elimination and returns on
gluten challenge. This will result in these cells being targeted and destroyed by
the person’s own immune system without any need for antibody production.
Furthermore, the gluten fragments responsible for this induction of MIC can cross
the gut barrier and be detected in many other parts of the body. There is
currently no evidence they induce MIC expression here, although it is an
interesting idea and a hypothetical cause for idiopathic (unknown cause) immune-
related diseases elsewhere in the body.
1862. GLUTEN AND GUT CELLS
A second set of problems are due to the growth-promoting effects of wheat germ
agglutinin. The gut surface is not flat in a healthy person. There are billions of
microscopic finger-like projections called "villi" which are used to increase the
surface area available for food absorption. In a normal, healthy person, the cells
lining these villi are being replaced continuously by the cells at the base of the villi
dividing, and the resultant immature cells gradually moving along to the tips of the
villi, in a fashion similar to an escalator. This process is carefully controlled so
that the immature cells produced down at the base of the villi will develop and
mature as they move up toward the tips (the main digestion site). When they get
to the tips they are in perfect working order and sport an array of food-processing
systems, for example, enzymes including sucrase to breakdown table sugar, and
isomaltase to complete the starch breakdown into glucose, as well as the main
fructose uptake system.
Wheat germ agglutinin acts on the cells at the base of the villi and tells them to
divide unnecessarily quickly. This results in the more rapid transition of cells up
to the tips of the villi before they have had sufficient time to mature and to set in
place their appropriate digestive surface components. For example, immature cells
at the villi tips may have insufficient functional lactase, the enzyme responsible for
breaking down lactose (the sugar found in milk). This would result in an apparent
inability to digest lactose properly (i.e. lactose intolerance), which can often be
seen secondary to gluten-related damage to the gut. Removal of gluten from the
diet may in time mean a person can again tolerate lactose, as the process
reverses.
1873. GLUTEN AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
Within both our brain and our gut there are small signalling molecules known as
endorphins, which are naturally occurring opiates. Unfortunately, there are
certain parts of gluten fragments which resemble these endorphins. Furthermore,
these gluten fragments can leave the gut and reach parts of the body where they
should not be present and thus they can interfere with normal signalling
processes.
The peptides from gluten are termed exorphins and they can interact with the
brain by mimicking the normal nerve transmitters. There is an association
between gluten intolerance and a wide assortment of emotional disorders,
conceivably due to this process. There is evidence that there may be an
association between gluten and depression or bipolar disorder and early
epidemiology suggests a possible link with schizophrenia. These conditions are
far more difficult to link to gluten.
In summary there are many conditions potentially related to gluten consumption
and a trial period of gluten elimination is not going to damage anyone.
188Stock Cupboard Essentials
This section contains various lists of things we think it's
useful to have to hand on a day-to-day basis, especially
items for gluten-free baking and specialist gluten-free
alternatives (not too many of those, this is the incidentally
gluten-free cookbook after all...).

191Special **Gluten-free** Items
Although most of the recipes in this book are incidentally gluten-free, there are a
few items where some care is needed - many supermarkets now have a special
section for people with ‘dietary needs’ where you can find a variety of useful
ingredients for the stock-cupboard. If buying these from elsewhere in the
supermarket, be sure you check the packet and ingredients very carefully – the
label should state gluten-free or suitable for coeliacs.

Soy sauce
Baking powder
Stock cubes
Worcester sauce
Green pesto
Rice flour, potato flour
Xanthan gum
Also good to have:
Flaked almonds, chopped almonds or nuts
